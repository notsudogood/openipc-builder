# Feedback-repair data-gathering build: PINNED, not tracking a branch, so the
# drone and the ground station (sbc-groundstations, same branch name) carry
# the identical mabur commit -- a mismatched pair has no control link and no
# video (mabur CLAUDE.md, "Deploy is two devices"). The commit is
# gilankpam/mabur c8f9863 + the feedback-repair rollout phases 1-3
# (docs/feedback-repair-rollout.md) on notsudogood/mabur branch
# claude/wifi-fpv-link-architecture-1bms9l. Phase 2 adds the drone's
# turnaround responder (T_TA_PONG, CAP_TURNAROUND), idle unless the GS pings.
# Phase 3 adds the listen window (T_STATUS/T_LWSTAT, CAP_LISTEN): a quiet gap
# after each burst, kept only while the GS's [listen] sends statuses.

# devourer comes from its own package, NOT from mabur's git submodule
# (MABUR_GIT_SUBMODULES is deliberately unset). The submodule records a fixed
# SHA that lags the fork's master, and the in-tree cross-build
# (tools/build-arm.sh) does not use the submodule either -- it points
# DEVOURER_DIR at a sibling checkout. Sourcing devourer separately keeps the
# buildroot build consistent with that and lets both trees float.
MABUR_DEPENDENCIES = libusb host-pkgconf devourer

# BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF: devourer's add_library(devourer ...) has no explicit
# STATIC/SHARED, so it follows BUILD_SHARED_LIBS. Buildroot defaults that ON,
# which built libdevourer.so -- but the recipe installs only maburd, so on target
# maburd died with "error while loading shared libraries: libdevourer.so".
# Forcing it OFF links devourer (and mabur_common) statically into maburd, the
# same self-contained layout tools/build-arm.sh produces; the only remaining
# runtime deps are Buildroot's own libusb/libstdc++/libc, which are on the image.
# (maburd also dlopens the SigmaStar MI libraries from the vendor rootfs at
# runtime -- that is why it must stay a glibc DYNAMIC executable.)
#
# DEVOURER_LOG_MAX_LEVEL=WARN: compile out info/debug/trace. devourer logs one
# info line per TX frame ("bulk_send EP 5 OK N bytes"); at maburd's frame rate
# that floods RAM-backed /tmp/mabur.log until the next respawn truncates it.
#
# The DEVOURER_* chip selects mirror tools/build-arm.sh. Without them every
# Realtek family is compiled in -- including DEVOURER_8733B, which defaults ON
# upstream and must be OFF here. Keep the two lists in step. The one
# deliberate difference: the Jaguar3 die is the board's Kconfig radio choice
# (Config.in), where build-arm.sh is always the 8822E -- the bench drone's
# card. Exactly one of the two is ON.
#
# MABUR_BUILD_GS/LINKBENCH=OFF: this is the drone image. maburgs and the bench
# harnesses are neither installed nor useful on the SSC338Q.

# Config, init script and binary all come from the same floating master
# checkout, which is the whole point: an unknown key fails boot and the wrapper
# then respawns maburd forever at 2 s, so the three must never be mixed across
# commits. The json/toml either-or that used to live here is gone -- the TOML
# cutover landed on master and bundle/mabur.default.json no longer exists.
#
# Since 2026-09-08 that bundle file is not a neutral seed but a verbatim copy
# of the drone's own /etc/mabur.toml, so a fresh flash boots the flight
# configuration rather than something nobody has flown. Retune it in the mabur
# repo (tests/test_config.cpp pins it), not only on the device.
